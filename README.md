# Project Overview

## Project Name 
[Event Handler](https://rodennis.github.io/event-handler/)

## Project Description

My website is an event info website! When you first visit the website it will ask you what event you would like info on. It will have a drop down menu of different future events you can choose from. Once an event is chosen you will then be presented with info about that chosen event. You will be given links to buy tickets and see seating arrangements.
